# ParserParserCompiler

This is the attempt to create
* a parser that parses an annotated EBNF
* and (at runtime!) creates a second parser with the EBNF
* plus a compiler with the annotations in the EBNF.

That new parser plus compiler should allow to compile an arbitrary language, specified in the EBNF and its annotations.
