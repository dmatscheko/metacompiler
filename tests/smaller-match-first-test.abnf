:description("If there are rules, where one rule is the first part of another, then the longer rule MUST be the first to be tried.
Otherwise the shorter rule would be found first, and the search position would be set to the char after the found rule.
In that wrong positioning, the second rule could therefore never be found and the first rule would often match without being the correct one.") ;
